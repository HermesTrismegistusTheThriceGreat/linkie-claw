# Templates

Templates enable users to package and distribute reusable service configurations. Railway offers a marketplace for sharing templates and a kickback program that rewards publishers when their templates are deployed.

## Kickback Program Overview

Template publishers earn revenue when others deploy their templates. The program offers "50% kickback of the usage cost incurred" with options to receive earnings as Railway Credits or cash withdrawals.

### Eligibility Requirements

Templates must be:
- Published to the official marketplace (private templates don't qualify)
- Compliant with Railway's "Fair Use Policy" and Terms of Service

### Earning Rates

The compensation structure varies by template type:
- Standard templates: 15% base rate
- With active user support: Additional 10% (25% total)
- Open source templates: 30% base, 50% with support

**Example**: If a deployment costs $200 and the template is open source with active support, the creator earns $100.

Minimum payout threshold is $0.01.

### User Support Channel

Template creators access user questions through the Template Queue in Central Station. Responding to inquiries qualifies for the 10% support bonus and triggers email notifications.

## Partner Program

Two partnership tiers exist:

**Basic Partners** receive the same kickback rates as individual creators and gain marketplace verification badges plus access to user feedback.

**Technology Partners** earn commissions on all templates using their technology (regardless of creator), receive dedicated marketplace pages, and access co-marketing opportunities.

## Earnings Management

Creators manage payouts through their account settings' earnings tab. The platform supports withdrawals in $100-$10,000 increments, with processing typically completed within 10 business days. Note that "Cash withdrawals are **not** supported in countries like **Brazil, China, and Russia**."

## Template Updates

GitHub-based templates support automatic updates. When creators push changes to the main branch, deployed users receive notifications and can apply updates at their discretion.
