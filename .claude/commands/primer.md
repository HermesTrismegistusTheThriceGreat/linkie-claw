# Prime Context for Linkie Claw

Start by reading the CLAUDE.md file to get project conventions, tech stack, and key file paths.

Read these key files to understand the project:

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Project overview, conventions, and agent team workflow
2. **docs/PREREQUISITES.md** - Setup checklist and environment variables
3. **src/lib/db/schema.ts** - Database schema (8 tables)
4. **src/lib/auth.ts** - Authentication configuration
5. **src/app/layout.tsx** - Root layout and providers
6. **src/middleware.ts** - Route protection
7. **package.json** - Dependencies and scripts

Then scan the directory structure:
- `src/app/` for routes and pages
- `src/components/` for UI components
- `src/lib/` for business logic and utilities
- `docs/roadmap/` for phase implementation docs

Explain back to me:
- Project structure and purpose
- Current phase status (what's done, what's remaining)
- Key files and their purposes
- Tech stack and important dependencies
- Any important conventions or constraints
